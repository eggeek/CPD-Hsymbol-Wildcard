\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

CPDs provide the state-of-the-art solution for path planning, 
but they may be unattractive because of substantial overhead required to construct and store them.
In this paper we explore the use of bounded suboptimal CPDs
based on centroids, 
that significantly reduces the precomputation time.
Applying this to standard forward CPDs fails to significantly reduce the memory requirements, which let us to introduce reverse CPDs.  
Reverse CPDs for centroids allow us to reduce the memory footprint of CPDs while bounding the suboptimality of paths returned. The resulting approach leads to faster path extraction than forward 
CPDs and, in practice, to much smaller difference in path length than the suboptimality bound guarantees. 
\ignore{
In future work, we can try to make improvement on compression of reverse CPDs by using other 
heuristic ordering or  introducing other heuristic symbols. 
There is a work that use CPDs as admissible heuristic function on path planning on changing cost graph~\cite{ijcai2019-167},
and we can also try to apply centroid-reverse CPDs on such problem.
