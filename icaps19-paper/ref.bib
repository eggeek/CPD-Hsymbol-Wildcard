	abstract = {{We consider the problem of determining whether a bipartite graph G has a hamiltonian cycle. We show that this problem is NP-complete for two classes of bipartite graphs: 2-connected cubic bipartite planar graphs; and 3-connected cubic bipartite graphs. Hence the hamiltonian cycle problem for these classes of graphs, or any larger class containing all such graphs, is probably computationally intractable.}},
