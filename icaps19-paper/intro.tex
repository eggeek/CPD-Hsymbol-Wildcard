\section{Introduction}

In the past we have considered the idea that a given move in a CPD can represented with two redundant symbols.
This way, at compression time, we can choose the symbol that leads to a better compression.
Specifically, we have considered move symbols (N, S, W, E, SE, SW, NE, NW) and a special symbol for default moves.
This is the work that Matteo is performing at the moment.

In this document we introduce a new type of a redundant symbol, called a \emph{centroid redundant symbol}.
In preliminary discussions in Delft we have called it the $\gamma$ symbol. 
(We need to choose a final name.)
