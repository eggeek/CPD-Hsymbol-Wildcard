  Path planning on gridmaps is a core AI problem, very popular in applications such as games. Compressed path patabases (CPDs) represent a state-of-the-art approach to the problem, in terms of the speed of computing full optimal paths and individual optimal moves. Despite significant improvements in recent years, the memory required to store a CPD can still be a bottleneck for large maps. We present an approach to improving the compression in CPDs. Our techniques use an extended notion of wildcards, and a novel concept called a redundant symbol. We implemented our ideas on top of a state-of-the-art CPD system. Experiments demonstrate a substantial reduction of the size of CPDs.
