\section{Compressed Path Databases}

The essence of a compressed path database is a data structure
that allows us to quickly extract for any pairs of points $S$ and $T$
in the graph a
first move to take from $S$ in order to reach $T$ optimally.

We restrict ourselves in the presentation to octile
grid graphs where the 8 possible moves from any position are
$N$, $S$, $E$, $W$, $NE$, $NW$, $SE$, and $SW$.
The ideas are generalizable to any graphs where ...

The compressed data base stores this infomration.
We assume a function $\textsf{CPD}($S$,$T$) which returns a
next move from $S$ which is part of some optimal path to $T$.
